This is a small example of passing strings back and forth over WASM, in a wasm3/js host. Since I need to support multiple wasm languages, the strings should be in a single format, and here I am exploring some differnt options.

Currently, I am doing a terrible thing where the host is holdng the last string return (with `set_buffer`) for the runtime, because I couldn't work out how to return a string pointer that worked in multiple hosts, in C.

## requirements

Before you get started, you will need some tools installed on your system.

- cmake
- llvm
- node/npm


On mac, with homebrew, I installed them like this:

```bash
brew install cmake node llvm
brew link --force llvm
```

Now, in the project-folder, run `npm i`

## chost

You can build this once, and use it for the all the WASM files to test C-host.

```bash
# build c host tester: you will need cmake/make
npm run build:chost
```

## Assemblyscript WASM

Included is a simple example assemblyscript-made WASM that illustrates a couple ways to pass strings.

```bash
# build the assemblyscript-based wasm
npm run build:aswasm

# run JS-host tests (using JS wrapper generated by assemblyscript)
npm run test:asjs

# run JS-host tests (using non-wrapped WASM)
npm run test:js build/aswasm.wasm

# run the wasm in C-host
npm run test:c build/aswasm.wasm
```

## C WASM

This is essentiually the same WASM, written in C.

```bash
# build the assemblyscript-based wasm
npm run build:cwasm

# run JS-host tests (using nopn-wrapped WASM)
npm run test:js build/cwasm.wasm

# run the wasm in C-host
npm run test:c build/cwasm.wasm
```
